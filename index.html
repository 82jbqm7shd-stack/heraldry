      <h2>The Origin of a Modern Scottish Grant of Arms</h2>
      <p>
        The arms granted to <strong>Mark Richard Hopking</strong> by the Court of the Lord Lyon in 2018 are a modern Scottish creation, lawfully constituted and recorded on <strong>page 90 of volume 93</strong> of the <em>Public Register of All Arms and Bearings in Scotland</em>. They do not purport to be inherited arms, nor do they assert continuity of armorial right across surnames. Rather, they represent a considered synthesis of documented armorial traditions associated with several ancestral family lines, together with long-standing family usage, refined and regularised under Scottish heraldic law.
      </p>
      <p>
        This page examines how the final blazon came about, the sources that informed it, and the distinction between established evidence and conjecture.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="section-scottish-context">
      <h2>Scottish Heraldic Context</h2>
      <p>
        In Scotland, heraldry is regulated by statute and administered by the Court of the Lord Lyon. Arms are individual, heritable property and may be borne only by those to whom they have been granted or matriculated. No right to arms arises merely from surname, descent, or custom.
      </p>
      <p>
        Accordingly, the arms discussed here exist <strong>because they were granted</strong>, not because of ancestry. Historical arms associated with surnames or families may inform the design of a new grant, but they do not in themselves confer armorial right.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Court of the Lord Lyon determines the legality and form of arms; symbolic interpretation lies outside its judicial function.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="section-methodology">
      <h2>Methodology and Sources</h2>
      <p>
        The design of the Hopking arms was informed by armorial precedents associated with five surnames appearing in the petitioner&rsquo;s ancestry:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Hopking / Hopkin(s)</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Walsham</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Scarlett</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Fortin</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Chivers</strong></li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These sources fall into three evidential categories:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Documented ancestral armigers</strong> (Walsham, Scarlett)</li>
        <li><strong>Surname-associated arms with no proven descent</strong> (Hopking / Hopkin(s))</li>
        <li><strong>Attested arms with no demonstrated genealogical connection</strong> (Fortin, Chivers)</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Where descent is unproven, this is stated explicitly. No claim of inherited armorial right is made in such cases.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="section-source-traditions">
      <h2>The Source Armorial Traditions</h2>

      <h3>Hopking / Hopkin(s)</h3>
      <p>
        There is no established tradition of Hopking arms in Scotland. In England, the surname appears in several variant forms&mdash;Hopkin, Hopkins, Hopkyn, Hopkyng&mdash;often co-located in early modern records, particularly in Northamptonshire.
      </p>
      <p>
        A blazon frequently associated with the surname is:
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Sable, on a chevron Or, between three ancient pistols, three roses Gules.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        While no genealogical descent from an English armiger bearing these arms has been demonstrated, this blazon provided the <strong>structural foundation</strong> for the Scottish grant. The field, chevron, pistols, and roses were retained as the principal elements of the shield.
      </p>
      <p>
        This use is explicitly one of <strong>surname association</strong>, not inheritance.
      </p>

      <h3>Walsham</h3>
      <p>
        The Walsham family forms a fully documented ancestral line, including the creation of a baronetcy in 1831. The arms borne by Sir John Walsham, 1st and 2nd Baronets, are well attested. In simplified form, they include:
      </p>
      <p>
        a <strong>cross voided Or</strong> on a <strong>field Sable</strong>, charged with <strong>crosses pat&eacute;e fitch&eacute;e</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the Scottish grant, the <strong>crosses pat&eacute;e fitch&eacute;e</strong> were adopted as the principal Walsham reference. Rather than reproducing the English arms wholesale, two such crosses were placed in the chief, flanking the central charge. The shared use of a black field in both Walsham and Hopkin arms further facilitated their integration.
      </p>

      <h3>Scarlett</h3>
      <p>
        The Scarlett arms are among the most securely evidenced influences. The arms of James Scarlett, 1st Baron Abinger, are recorded as:
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Chequy Or and Gules, a lion rampant Ermine; on a canton Azure, a castle triple-towered Argent.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        A Jamaican variant of the Scarlett arms likewise places a <strong>lion rampant Ermine</strong> prominently on a field incorporating Azure.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the Scottish grant, the <strong>lion rampant Ermine</strong> was adopted as the central charge of the chief, reflecting both genealogical significance and heraldic prominence. The castle was not incorporated, as the crest already fulfilled a distinct symbolic role.
      </p>

      <h3>Fortin</h3>
      <p>
        The surname Fortin appears in continental armorial sources, notably in Reitstap&rsquo;s <em>Armorial G&eacute;n&eacute;ral</em>, where arms are recorded as:
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>D&rsquo;Azure, &agrave; deux dragons d&rsquo;Or.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        No evidence has been established linking the petitioner genealogically to an armigerous Fortin family. Accordingly, no claim is made to Fortin arms. Their influence is confined to the <strong>use of Azure</strong> as a tincture within the Scottish design. The dragon charge was deliberately excluded.
      </p>

      <h3>Chivers</h3>
      <p>
        The Chivers arms are unusual but well documented in heraldic literature, notably as:
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Argent, three cinquefoils Gules, and a giron Azure.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        As with Fortin, no proven descent has been demonstrated. The Chivers influence is therefore limited to colour language rather than charge. The <strong>Azure</strong> element was absorbed into the chief as part of a broader secondary tincture scheme.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="section-synthesis">
      <h2>Synthesis of the Scottish Arms</h2>
      <p>
        The final Scottish arms bring together these influences in a manner consistent with Scottish heraldic practice, while remaining distinct and original.
      </p>

      <h3>Shield</h3>
      <p>
        The shield retains the Hopkin structural blazon:
      </p>
      <p>
        a field <strong>Sable</strong>, a chevron <strong>Or</strong>, three <strong>ancient pistols</strong>, and three <strong>roses Gules</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Upon this foundation, a <strong>chief Azure</strong> was introduced to carry the principal ancestral references:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>A <strong>lion rampant Ermine</strong> (from Scarlett), centrally placed</li>
        <li><strong>Two crosses pat&eacute;e fitch&eacute;e Or</strong> (from Walsham), flanking the lion</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Azure serves as a secondary tincture, informed by Fortin and Chivers armorial colour usage.
      </p>

      <h3>The Fillet Argent</h3>
      <p>
        In the arms as originally petitioned, the chief Azure lay directly upon the field Sable. Under Scottish heraldic law, direct colour-on-colour adjacency between field and chief requires formal separation. At the stage of grant, the Lord Lyon introduced a <strong>fillet Argent</strong> in the lower part of the chief, thereby separating Azure from Sable and bringing the arms into full compliance with the Laws of Arms. This was a <strong>technical heraldic refinement</strong>, not a symbolic addition, and it preserved the conceptual integrity of the design.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="section-helm">
      <h2>Helm</h2>
      <p>
        In accordance with Scottish practice, the Letters Patent depict a helm befitting the petitioner&rsquo;s degree at the time of grant, when he did not yet hold a Scottish feudal barony. Following the later acquisition of the Barony of Balvill, the armiger is thereafter entitled, by custom, to depict a helm appropriate to that dignity in subsequent artistic renderings. The original grant remains unaltered, and no inconsistency arises between the juridical record and later representational usage.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="section-crest-motto">
      <h2>Crest and Motto</h2>

      <h3>Crest</h3>
      <p>
        The crest&mdash;a double-turreted tower in prospect, flammant, standing on a rock&mdash;has been used within the family for generations, notably on signet rings and personal items. No documentary source has been identified, and no claim is made to its antiquity or original grant.
      </p>
      <p>
        Its resemblance to the castle badge associated with the Suffolk Regiment is acknowledged, but no connection is asserted. The crest is therefore presented as a <strong>traditional family emblem</strong>, formally regularised through the Scottish grant.
      </p>

      <h3>Motto</h3>
      <p>
        The motto <strong>TANTUM OPTIMUS EST</strong>, which translates as <strong>&ldquo;Only the Best&rdquo;</strong>, originated as a family expression, reflecting a long-standing personal characteristic rather than a historical motto inherited from armigerous ancestors. Its later Latinisation was adopted to suit heraldic convention.
      </p>
      <p>
        Possible earlier mottoes associated with related families were identified only after the grant and are noted as historical curiosities rather than sources.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="section-arms-as-granted">
      <h2>The Arms as Granted</h2>
      <p>
        The arms, crest, motto, and pennon exist as a single juridical creation of the Court of the Lord Lyon. While informed by ancestry and tradition, their authority derives solely from the grant itself as recorded on page 90 of volume 93 of the <em>Public Register of All Arms and Bearings in Scotland</em>.
