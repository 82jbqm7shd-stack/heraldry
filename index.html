    <section id="origin">
      <h2>The Origin of a Modern Scottish Grant of Arms</h2>
      
      <p>
        The arms granted to Mark Richard Hopking by the Court of the Lord Lyon in 2018 are a modern Scottish creation,
        lawfully constituted and recorded on page 90 of volume 93 of the <em>Public Register of All Arms and Bearings in Scotland</em>.<sup><a href="#ref-1">[1]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref-2">[2]</a></sup>
        They do not purport to be inherited arms, nor do they assert continuity of armorial right across surnames.
        Rather, they represent a considered synthesis of documented armorial traditions associated with several ancestral
        family lines, together with long-standing family usage, refined and regularised under Scottish heraldic law.
      </p>

      <p>
        This page examines how the final blazon came about, the sources that informed it, and the distinction between
        established evidence and conjecture.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="scottish-context">
      <h2>Scottish Heraldic Context</h2>
      
      <p>
        In Scotland, heraldry is regulated by statute and administered by the Court of the Lord Lyon. Arms are individual,
        heritable property and may be borne only by those to whom they have been granted or matriculated. No right to arms
        arises merely from surname, descent, or custom.
      </p>

      <p>
        Accordingly, the arms discussed here exist <strong>because they were granted</strong>, not because of ancestry.
        Historical arms associated with surnames or families may inform the design of a new grant, but they do not in
        themselves confer armorial right.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Court of the Lord Lyon determines the legality and form of arms; symbolic interpretation lies outside its
        judicial function.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="methodology">
      <h2>Methodology and Sources</h2>
      
      <p>
        The design of the Hopking arms was informed by armorial precedents associated with five surnames appearing in
        the petitioner's ancestry:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Hopking / Hopkin(s)</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Walsham</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Scarlett</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Fortin</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Chivers</strong></li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        These sources fall into three evidential categories:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li><strong>Documented ancestral armigers</strong> (Walsham, Scarlett)</li>
        <li><strong>Surname-associated arms with no proven descent</strong> (Hopking / Hopkin(s))</li>
        <li><strong>Attested arms with no demonstrated genealogical connection</strong> (Fortin, Chivers)</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        Where descent is unproven, this is stated explicitly. No claim of inherited armorial right is made in such cases.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="source-traditions">
      <h2>The Source Armorial Traditions</h2>

      <h3 id="hopking">Hopking / Hopkin(s)</h3>

      <div class="image-figure">
        <figure>
          <img src="Hopkin.jpg" alt="Arms traditionally attributed to the surname Hopkin" />
          <figcaption>
            Arms traditionally attributed to the surname Hopkin; used here as a structural armorial reference,
            not as inherited arms.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
      </div>

      <p>
        <strong>There is no established tradition of arms borne under the surname Hopking in Scotland.</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        In England, however, the surname appears historically in several variant forms—<em>Hopkin</em>, <em>Hopkins</em>,
        <em>Hopkyn</em>, and <em>Hopkyng</em>—which are frequently co-located in early modern records, particularly in
        Northamptonshire. These spellings reflect orthographic variation in historical record-keeping rather than distinct
        surnames in the modern sense.
      </p>

      <p>
        The armorial material discussed below relates to the surname <em>Hopkin</em> as it appears in English armorial sources.
        It is presented for contextual and comparative purposes only and does not imply the existence of inherited, historically
        borne, or genealogically transmissible arms for the modern surname <em>Hopking</em>.
      </p>

      <p>
        A blazon frequently associated with the surname is:
      </p>

      <p style="margin-left: 2rem; font-style: italic;">
        Sable, on a chevron Or, between three ancient pistols, three roses Gules.
      </p>

      <p>
        While no genealogical descent from an English armiger bearing these arms has been demonstrated, this blazon provided
        the <strong>structural foundation</strong> for the Scottish grant. The field, chevron, pistols, and roses were retained
        as the principal elements of the shield.
      </p>

      <p>
        This use is explicitly one of <strong>surname association</strong>, not inheritance.
      </p>

      <h3 id="walsham">Walsham</h3>

      <div class="image-figure">
        <figure>
          <img src="80 Walsham 2nd Baronet of Knill Court.jpg" alt="Ancient Walsham arms, as borne within the composite arms of the Walsham baronets" />
          <figcaption>
            Simplified representation of the ancient Walsham arms. In the arms borne by Sir John James Garbett Walsham,
            1st Baronet, and Sir John Walsham, 2nd Baronet of Knill Court, the ancient Walsham arms occupy the upper-left
            (dexter chief) position within a more complex composite achievement arranged in three rows of three.<sup><a href="#ref-3">[3]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref-4">[4]</a></sup>
            The simplified arms are shown here solely to illustrate the armorial source of the crosses patée fitchée
            incorporated into the Scottish grant.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
      </div>

      <p>
        The Walsham family constitutes a fully documented armigerous ancestral line. Documentary evidence establishes that
        the arms borne by the 1st and 2nd Walsham Baronets were not quartered in the conventional heraldic sense, but formed
        a composite arrangement of nine armorial bearings displayed in three rows of three.<sup><a href="#ref-3">[3]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref-4">[4]</a></sup>
      </p>

      <p>
        Within this composite achievement, the ancient Walsham arms occupied the first position. It is this ancient Walsham
        element alone that is referenced on this page. No claim is made to the composite arms as a whole, nor to any broader
        armorial inheritance beyond that expressly incorporated into the Scottish grant.
      </p>

      <p style="margin-left: 2rem; font-style: italic;">
        Sable, on a cross voided Or, five crosses patée fitchée of the last.
      </p>

      <p>
        This blazon represents the ancient Walsham arms only, as distinct from both the later composite arms borne by the
        Walsham baronets and the subsequent quartered arms borne by later descendants, including Mark Hopking's great-grandfather.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the Scottish grant, the <strong>crosses patée fitchée</strong> were adopted as the principal Walsham reference.
        Rather than reproducing the English arms wholesale, two such crosses were placed in the chief, flanking the central charge.
        The shared use of a black field in both Walsham and Hopkin arms further facilitated their integration within a coherent
        Scottish design.
      </p>

      <p>
        Together, these successive forms represent the historical development of a single Walsham armorial tradition. Only its
        ancient form is referenced here as an armorial source; later composite and quartered expressions are noted solely as
        genealogical and evidential context.
      </p>

      <h3 id="scarlett">Scarlett</h3>

      <div class="image-figure">
        <figure>
          <img src="79 Scarlett 1st Baron Abinger.png" alt="Arms of Sir James Scarlett, 1st Baron Abinger" />
          <figcaption>
            Arms of Sir James Scarlett, 1st Baron Abinger, illustrating the Scarlett armorial tradition in its peerage form.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
      </div>

      <p>
        The Scarlett family represents a senior armigerous line with a well-documented and continuous heraldic tradition.
        Across multiple branches and successive generations—including the Jamaican branch, the peerage of Baron Abinger,
        and later complex quartered forms—the core Scarlett arms consistently feature a <strong>lion rampant Ermine</strong>.<sup><a href="#ref-5">[5]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref-6">[6]</a></sup>
      </p>

      <p>
        Although the Scarlett arms were subject over time to augmentation, quartering, and the addition of cantons, supporters,
        and external ornaments, the lion rampant Ermine remained a stable and recognisable armorial element. Even in later
        composite achievements, the Scarlett arms proper, bearing the lion rampant Ermine, customarily occupy the first position.
      </p>

      <p style="margin-left: 2rem; font-style: italic;">
        Chequy Or and Gules, a lion rampant Ermine; on a canton Azure a castle triple-towered Argent.
      </p>

      <p>
        This blazon represents the Scarlett arms proper, abstracted from later elaborations and quarterings. No claim is made
        on this page to the peerage arms, supporters, coronets, or subsequent quartered achievements associated with later
        members of the family.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the Scottish grant of arms to Mark Hopking, the <strong>lion rampant Ermine</strong> was adopted as the sole Scarlett
        reference. Its long-standing continuity across the Scarlett armorial tradition, and its ability to stand independently
        as a heraldic charge without importing English peerage apparatus, made it particularly suited to incorporation within
        a Scottish heraldic design.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Scarlett arms are therefore treated here as a single, continuous armorial source, expressed historically in
        increasingly elaborate forms, but unified by the persistent use of the lion rampant Ermine as their defining charge.
      </p>

      <div class="note">
        <strong>Scarlett descent.</strong> The connection to the Scarlett family is through Florence Scarlett (born 20 March 1844),
        daughter of Peter Campbell Scarlett CB, DL, who was the son of Sir James Scarlett, 1st Baron Abinger. Florence married
        Sir John Walsham, 2nd Baronet, establishing the documented Walsham-Scarlett line through which descent is traced.
      </div>

      <h3 id="fortin">Fortin</h3>

      <div class="image-figure">
        <figure>
          <img src="Fortin.png" alt="Arms attributed to Fortin in continental armorial sources" />
          <figcaption>
            Arms attributed to Fortin in continental armorial sources; referenced here for tincture only,
            without genealogical claim.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
      </div>

      <p>
        The surname Fortin appears in continental armorial sources, notably in Reitstap's <em>Armorial Général</em>, where
        arms are recorded as:
      </p>

      <p style="margin-left: 2rem; font-style: italic;">
        D'Azure, à deux dragons d'Or.
      </p>

      <p>
        No evidence has been established linking the petitioner genealogically to an armigerous Fortin family. Accordingly,
        no claim is made to Fortin arms. Their influence is confined to the <strong>use of Azure</strong> as a tincture within
        the Scottish design. The dragon charge was deliberately excluded.
      </p>

      <h3 id="chivers">Chivers</h3>

      <div class="image-figure">
        <figure>
          <img src="Chivers.png" alt="Arms attributed to Chivers in British armorial sources" />
          <figcaption>
            Arms attributed to Chivers in British armorial sources; influence confined to colour language rather than charge.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
      </div>

      <p>
        The Chivers arms are unusual but well documented in heraldic literature, notably as:
      </p>

      <p style="margin-left: 2rem; font-style: italic;">
        Argent, three cinquefoils Gules, and a giron Azure.
      </p>

      <p>
        As with Fortin, no proven descent has been demonstrated. The Chivers influence is therefore limited to colour language
        rather than charge. The <strong>Azure</strong> element was absorbed into the chief as part of a broader secondary
        tincture scheme.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="synthesis">
      <h2>Synthesis of the Scottish Arms</h2>
      
      <p>
        The final Scottish arms bring together these influences in a manner consistent with Scottish heraldic practice,
        while remaining distinct and original.
      </p>

      <h3 id="shield">Shield</h3>

      <div class="image-figure">
        <figure>
          <img src="Shield.png" alt="The shield of the arms of Mark Richard Hopking as granted by the Court of the Lord Lyon" />

      </div>

      <p>
        The shield retains the Hopkin structural blazon: a field <strong>Sable</strong>, a chevron <strong>Or</strong>,
        three <strong>ancient pistols</strong>, and three <strong>roses Gules</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Upon this foundation, a <strong>chief Azure</strong> was introduced to carry the principal ancestral references:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>A <strong>lion rampant Ermine</strong> (from Scarlett), centrally placed</li>
        <li><strong>Two crosses patée fitchée Or</strong> (from Walsham), flanking the lion</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Azure serves as a secondary tincture, informed by Fortin and Chivers armorial colour usage.
      </p>

      <h3 id="fillet">The Fillet Argent</h3>

      <p>
        In the arms as originally petitioned, the chief Azure lay directly upon the field Sable. Under Scottish heraldic law,
        direct colour-on-colour adjacency between field and chief requires formal separation. At the stage of grant, the Lord
        Lyon introduced a <strong>fillet Argent</strong> in the lower part of the chief, thereby separating Azure from Sable
        and bringing the arms into full compliance with the Laws of Arms.
      </p>

      <p>
        This was a <strong>technical heraldic refinement</strong>, not a symbolic addition, and it preserved the conceptual
        integrity of the design. The initial warrant was issued without the fillet, but when preparing the grant for the Herald
        Artist, the tincture rule violation was identified. A revised warrant incorporating the fillet Argent was issued at the
        last moment to resolve this technical issue.

      <h2>Helm</h2>
      
      <p>
        In accordance with Scottish practice, the Letters Patent depict a helm befitting the petitioner's degree at the time
        of grant in 2018, when he did not yet hold a Scottish feudal barony. At that time, the appropriate helm was that of
        an Esquire.
      </p>

      <p>
        Following the later acquisition of the Barony of Balvill in 2025, the armiger is thereafter entitled, by custom, to
        depict a helm appropriate to that dignity in subsequent artistic renderings. The original grant remains unaltered, and
        no inconsistency arises between the juridical record and later representational usage.

      <h2>Crest and Motto</h2>

      <div class="image-figure">

          <figcaption>
            Crest as formally granted and depicted in the full Scottish achievement of arms.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
      </div>

      <p>
        The crest—<strong>a double-turreted tower in prospect Argent, masoned Sable, flammant on a rock Proper</strong>—has
        been used within the family for generations, notably on signet rings and personal items. Documentary evidence of its
        use extends back five generations.
      </p>

      <p>
        No documentary source has been identified for the crest's original adoption, and no claim is made to its antiquity or
        original grant. Its resemblance to the castle badge associated with the Suffolk Regiment is acknowledged, but no
        connection is asserted.
      </p>

      <p>
        The crest is therefore presented as a <strong>traditional family emblem</strong>, formally regularised through the
        Scottish grant. An early family document from the nineteenth century shows a slightly different blazon, described as
        "A Flaming Fort" with the motto "Inter Primos" (Among the First) or "Coming the first / otherwise always in the front."
        This historical variant was discovered only after the 2018 grant had been made.
      </p>

      <p>
        The granted blazon represents a modernised and technically precise description of the crest as it had evolved in family
        usage by the time of the petition.
      </p>

      <h3 id="motto">Motto</h3>

      <div class="image-figure">
        <figure>
          <img src="Motto.png" alt="The motto TANTUM OPTIMUS EST as depicted in the Scottish grant of arms" />
          <figcaption>
            The motto <em>TANTUM OPTIMUS EST</em> as depicted in the Scottish grant of arms.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
      </div>

      <p>
        The motto <strong>TANTUM OPTIMUS EST</strong>, which translates as <strong>"Only the Best"</strong>, originated as a
        personal family expression specific to Mark Hopking, reflecting a long-standing characteristic rather than a historical
        motto inherited from armigerous ancestors. The phrase existed in English within the family and was Latinised for the
        heraldic grant.
      </p>

      <p>
        The historical motto "Inter Primos" (Among the First), discovered on the early family crest document after the 2018 grant
        had been completed, represents an intriguing parallel. Both mottoes express themes of primacy and excellence, though they
        were adopted independently and at different times.
      </p>

      <p>
        The granted motto TANTUM OPTIMUS EST is therefore a modern, personal expression, distinct from any historical family motto,
        though thematically consonant with the earlier "Inter Primos."

        The arms, crest, motto, and pennon exist as a single juridical creation of the Court of the Lord Lyon. While informed
